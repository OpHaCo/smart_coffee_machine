Stavros' KiCad components
=========================

These are just my KiCad components. I haven't tested them, I haven't printed
them, I just made them in KiCad to try and print some PCBs. Pull
requests/additions very welcome!

Contains:
* A PIR motion sensor, like [this one](http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/images/PIR-motion-sensor-pinout.png),
  but my pins seem to be reversed. I think I got a defective batch.
* A [NodeMCU 0.9](http://www.cnx-software.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/NodeMCU_v0.9_Pinout.png),
  the one that takes up a whole breadboard.
* A [NodeMCU Amica R2](http://www.electrodragon.com/product/nodemcu-lua-amica-r2-esp8266-wifi-board/),
  the one that doesn't take up a whole breadboard.
* A [Tiny Breakout v1.1](https://github.com/skorokithakis/tiny-ESP8266-breakout).
* A [Tiny Breakout v1.2](https://github.com/skorokithakis/tiny-ESP8266-breakout).
* A [photoresistor module](http://hobbycomponents.com/sensors/160-photoresistive-light-dependent-resistor-module-ky-018),
  which I also think has the pins wired nonstandardly.
* A DHT11 [temperature/humidity sensor](http://hobbycomponents.com/sensors/84-dht11-arduino-compatible-digital-temperature-humidity-sensor-module).
* A DHT22 [temperature/humidity sensor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/385).
* A [433 MHz RF receiver/transmitter pair](http://tinkersphere.com/wireless-modules-for-raspberry-pi-and-arduino/485-rf-link-transmitter-receiver-module-pair-433mhz-or-315mhz-for-arduino-raspberry-pi-b-b.html).
* A random L298N-based H-bridge from eBay.

Enjoy, no guarantees, etc!
